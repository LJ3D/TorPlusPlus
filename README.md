# TorPlusPlus
C++ library for talking to a TOR hidden service.
## You need to manually do this:
Requires the "tor" folder from the "Tor Expert Bundle" to be placed next to the executable.
(This file can be downloaded from https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/)


I might make some kind of script to automate doing this, I dont want to just place the files in here as they will become outdated.

# Platform support
Currently, I have this header set up for windows exclusively. Will add linux support in the future™

# Example
Current example can be seen in test.cpp. This file will be removed some time soon, when I do that I will add something here.

# ⚠️ Security ⚠️
⚠️ Absolutely no guarantees on security/anonymity when using this code to talk to TOR services ⚠️
